# DIG SIDEKICK ASSIGNMENT
This is the front-end part of the DIG SIDEKICK ASSIGNMENT powered with React. This is small (only contains prescribed functionality) but beautiful front-end
project. Here, users can sign up (creation), log in, see their profile, update their credentials, and see other users with searching and pagination. Users have also 
the option of deleting their profile or logout. Route protection is ensured for restricting unauthorized access to certain routes and APIs. Besides, proper error handling is applied with alert UI to notify users about the error. The popular library bootstrap is used for styling UIs. The project is well-structured to minimize the chances of bugs and meet the scaling-up demand. Below is the complete instruction on how to use this project.
